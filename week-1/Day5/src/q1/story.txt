There was a boy named John who was so lazy he couldnâ€™t even change his clothes.
One day, he saw the apple tree in their yard was full of fruits.
He wanted to eat some apples, but he was too lazy to climb the tree and take the fruits.
So he lay down underneath the tree and waited for the fruits to fall off.
John waited until he was starving, but the apples never fell.
